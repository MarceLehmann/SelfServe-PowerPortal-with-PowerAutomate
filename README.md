SelfServe PowerPortal with PowerAutomate
Welcome to the SelfServe PowerPortal with PowerAutomate repository! This solution is designed to simplify self-service operations using PowerAutomate.

Quick Setup
Import the Solution: Begin by importing the SelfServe PowerPortal with PowerAutomate solution into your environment.

Configure Workflow 1 (wf1): Within the settings of wf1, you will find a placeholder for an HTTP request URL. This is where you need to specify the URL of wf2. By linking the two workflows, you're essentially setting the foundation for the SelfServe PowerPortal to function correctly.

Important Note
Make sure that wf2 is set up and running before you update its HTTP request URL in wf1. This ensures that the two workflows can communicate seamlessly.
