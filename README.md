# Power Platform Solution

## Overview
This repository contains a Power Platform solution that streamlines the process of secure self-service with the Power Platform. The solution allows users to access a secure HTML page via a static URL or OTP, providing both data retrieval and dynamic interactions. 

**For a detailed walkthrough and insights, check out my [blog post](https://lehmann.ws/2023/08/09/selfserve-powerportal-with-powerautomate/).**

## Setup Instructions

1. Navigate to `wf1`.
2. In the settings of `wf1`, you'll find a section for the HTTP request URL.
3. Paste the HTTP request URL of `wf2` into this section.

That's it! This ensures seamless communication between `wf1` and `wf2`.

## Features
- Secure login using static URL or OTP.
- Personalized data retrieval for authenticated users.
